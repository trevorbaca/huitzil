\textbf{Interpretation.} The piece comprises two parts separated by a cadenza.
The first 54 measures interweave three musical voices. Vibrato is allowed and
the tempo can vary, per the usual interpretation of `music'; no further
indications appear in the first half of the piece. Distinguish the voices ---
black, blue, red --- ad libitum, though chiefly in phrasing and dynamics. ``You
must decide what to do with the notes.'' The conceit in the first half of piece
has to do with the dreams of the score's inscription: each voice carries a wish
from a lover to her beloved; each voice is touched by the sadness of being left
behind.

The second half of the piece separates the right hand from the left. Fourteen
string contact points, or SCPs, notate on a dedicated staff given at the top of
each system. Heavy staff lines indicate points directly on the wood
of the bridge
\raisebox{0.125 em}{\scalebox{0.375}{\circled{OB}}},
directly over the end of the
fingerboard
\raisebox{0.125 em}{\scalebox{0.375}{\circled{T0}}},
and all the way up the fingerboard as
close to the position of the left hand as possible
\raisebox{0.125 em}{\scalebox{0.375}{\circled{T+}}}.
Intermediate staff positions give degrees of
ponticello (on solid staff lines) and successive positions up the length of the
fingerboard (on dashed staff lines):
