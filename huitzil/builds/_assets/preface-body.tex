She says:

\textit{``Do not look in his eye but whisper instead to his ear. His giant
round ear let to droop from the weight of obsidian curves of the lobe. He will
ask you to pierce the bend of his tongue with the needle-sharp point of
your beak. But pierce you must not. You must carry to him my record of dreams
and the future they describe as I sleep. You must speak silently to him the
words of our wedding and the wishes of birds that they carry with them as their
freight. He will remember our dreaming-together and the heaviness we shared in
our sleep. Then he will close his eyes. And when he does you must brush with
your wings the bend of his ear and leave there like sand the husks of my words
which he in his sleep will know but not hear. Then in the daylight he will
carry with him our record of dreams and the future they describe as I sleep.''}

Hummingbird carries her words like salt on his wings and takes to the sky in
his flight.
